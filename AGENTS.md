# AGENTS.md — Kyma Infrastructure Manager

This file provides AI agents (Cursor, Copilot, Codex, etc.) with the context needed to contribute effectively to this repository.

## Project Overview

**Kyma Infrastructure Manager (KIM)** is a Kubernetes operator built with [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) that manages the Kyma cluster infrastructure on top of [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/).

Core responsibilities:
- Provisioning and reconciling Gardener `Shoot` clusters via the `Runtime` CRD.
- Generating and rotating Secrets containing dynamic kubeconfigs via the `GardenerCluster` CRD.
- Bootstrapping runtime components (OIDC, ConfigMaps, registry cache, namespace creation, ClusterRoleBindings).

Module path: `github.com/kyma-project/infrastructure-manager`  
Go version: see `go.mod`  
FIPS build flag: `GOFIPS140=v1.0.0` is required for all builds.

## Custom Resources

| CRD | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Runtime` (`runtime_types.go`) | Desired state of a Gardener Shoot cluster. Drives the FSM-based reconciler. |
| `GardenerCluster` (`gardenercluster_types.go`) | Manages kubeconfig Secret generation and rotation for an existing Shoot. |

### Runtime States
`Pending` → `Ready` | `Failed` | `Terminating`

### Runtime Condition Types
`Provisioned`, `KubeconfigReady`, `OidcAndConfigMapConfigured`, `KymaSystemNSCreated`, `Configured`, `Deprovisioned`, `RegistryCacheConfigured`, `RuntimeBootstrapperReady`

---

## Architecture: FSM

The `Runtime` controller is driven by a **finite-state machine** (`internal/controller/runtime/fsm/`). Each state is a `stateFn` — a function with the signature:

```go
type stateFn func(context.Context, *fsm, *systemState) (stateFn, *ctrl.Result, error)
```

Each file in the `fsm/` package implements one or a small group of related states (e.g. `runtime_fsm_create_shoot.go`, `runtime_fsm_patch_shoot.go`). The FSM starts at `sFnTakeSnapshot` and transitions until a `nil` state is returned.

When adding a new state:
1. Create `runtime_fsm_<name>.go` with the state function and a corresponding `runtime_fsm_<name>_test.go`.
2. Wire the state into the FSM transition chain from an existing state.
3. Update condition types in `api/v1/runtime_types.go` if a new condition is introduced.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build (requires FIPS flag)
make build

# Run locally against a cluster
make run

# Generate CRD manifests and DeepCopy methods
make manifests generate

# Format and vet
make fmt vet
```

The `make build` and `make run` targets automatically run `manifests`, `generate`, `fmt`, and `vet` before compiling. `make test` also runs those steps in addition to setting up `envtest`.

---

## Testing

```bash
# Unit + integration tests (uses envtest, no live cluster needed)
make test

# End-to-end tests (requires a live k3d/remote cluster)
KUBECONFIG_K3D=<path> go test ./test/e2e -v -timeout 30m
```

- Unit/integration tests live alongside source files (`*_test.go`) and use `envtest` for a local API server.
- Mocks are generated with `mockery` and live in `mocks/` subdirectories — do **not** edit them manually.
- E2E tests live in `test/e2e/` and run against a real cluster.
- Coverage is written to `coverage.txt`.

---

## Contributing Workflow

- All contributions must be submitted as pull requests from a **personal fork** of the repository — do not push feature branches directly to `kyma-project/kyma-infrastructure-manager`.
- Fork the repo, commit changes to a branch on your fork, then open a PR against `main` on the upstream repository.

---

## Code Conventions

- All new Go files must begin with the Apache-2.0 copyright header from `hack/boilerplate.go.txt`.
- Use `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime` patterns: reconcile via `ctrl.Result`, patch via `client.MergeFrom`, record events via `record.EventRecorder`.
- Errors: prefer `github.com/pkg/errors` for wrapping (`errors.Wrap`, `errors.Wrapf`).
- Logging: use `logr.Logger` (injected into FSM). Levels: `DEBUG` = 1, `TRACE` = 2 (see `internal/log_level`).
- Validation: struct-level validation uses `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10`.
- New shoot spec concerns go into `pkg/gardener/shoot/extender/` as a new extender file.
- Avoid adding direct `k8s.io/client-go` rest calls — use `controller-runtime` client abstractions.

## Runtime Annotations (Troubleshooting)

| Annotation | Effect |
|---|---|
| `operator.kyma-project.io/force-patch-reconciliation: "true"` | Force next reconciliation into patch state regardless of generation number. Removed automatically after the attempt. |
| `operator.kyma-project.io/suspend-patch-reconciliation: "true"` | Prevents the controller from patching the Shoot. Must be removed manually to resume. |
| `operator.kyma-project.io/force-kubeconfig-rotation: "true"` | Forces kubeconfig Secret rotation before the scheduled time (on `GardenerCluster` CR). |
